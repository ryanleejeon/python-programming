# Conditional Statements:
# use the if-elif-else structure, don't forget to have a >, < or == after the if and elif


## 1:
# num = 10
# if num > 0:
#     print("The number", num, "is less than 0")
# elif num < 0: 
#     print("The number", num, "is greater than 0")
# else:
#     print("The number is 0")

## 2: 
# You can "nest" another if statement within another like this:
# x = 10
# y = 20

# if x > 5:
#     if y > 10:
#         print("x,", x, ", and y,", y, ", are greater than 5 and 10, respectively")
#     else:
#         print("x is greater than 5, but y is not greater than 10")
# else: 
#     print("x is not greater than 10")

## 3: Ternary operators:
# x = 10
# if x > 0:
#     result = "positive"
# else:
#     result = "negative"

## using the above, let's "convert" it to ternary form
# result = "positive" if x > 0 else "negative"
# print(result)

## nested ternary operators:
# x = 10
# result = "positive" if x > 0 else ("negative" if x < 0 else "zero")
## so same as above, but you add a condition after the second one, and wrap that in parantheses
